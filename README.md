# 🚀 ROS2 Servo Motor Controller

Hey there, robotics enthusiasts! 👋  
I'm **Ali Khaleghi**, a systems-oriented developer passionate about building resilient, scalable infrastructure for distributed robotics. This repository is part of my journey to create a robust servo motor controller using **ROS 2 Humble** — designed for precision, modularity, and real-world deployment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project provides a clean and extensible framework for controlling servo motors using ROS 2. Whether you're prototyping a robotic arm, building an autonomous rover, or experimenting with IoT devices, this package gives you the tools to command servo motors with accuracy and flexibility.

It’s built with maintainability in mind: annotated code, modular nodes, and clear separation between hardware interfaces and ROS logic. I’ve designed it to be beginner-friendly while still offering depth for advanced robotics workflows.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🌀 **ROS 2 Topic-Based Control** — Send angle commands via standard ROS messages  
- ⚙️ **Parameterizable Nodes** — Easily configure motor limits, speed, and update rates  
- 🔁 **Modular Architecture** — Clean separation of logic, hardware, and configuration  
- 🧪 **Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble**  
- 📚 **Well-documented for reproducibility and collaboration**
